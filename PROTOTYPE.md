# APCS Final Project
## Technical Details:

Period 4
**Group Members**: Amy Zhou, Cody Cai
**Group Name**: OptiX

## Project Discription 
We intend to model the interference of light through a diffraction simulator that provides a user interface of the interaction of light waves via three modes: single slit diffraction, double slit diffraction, and diffraction gratings. The detector screen and individual interferences of the light rays will be visible, and the user will be able to customize factors that influence diffraction, namely wavelength of light, distance to screen, and distance between slits (if applicable). It uses the formula dsin(θ) = mλ to model the detector screen pattern and y(x,t) = 2Acos

It uses the formula dsin(θ) = mλ to model the detector screen pattern and y(x,t) = 2Acos(φ)sin(kx-ωt+φ) to model the interference between two light waves. 
     
# Project Design

UML Diagrams and descriptions of key algorithms, classes, and how things fit together.


    
# Intended pacing:

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
