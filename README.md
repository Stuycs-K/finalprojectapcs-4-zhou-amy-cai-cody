# Diffraction Simulator
## OptiX: Amy Zhou & Cody Cai 

# Project Description

Our project aims to model single and double slit diffraction and the interference patterns generated from both experiments. When the simulation begins, planar waves will propagate across the screen. Once they hit the slits, they will diffract outwards until they hit the detector, where the interference bands are formed. The frequency of the wave can be modified using a frequency slider to visualize different colors of light and their interference patterns.

# How to Use the Simulation

There is a frequency slider at the top-left of the screen to modify the frequency and thus color of the waves on screen. The colors range from red to violet, just like in a standard rainbow. The lowest frequency corresponds to red, whereas the highest frequency corresponds to violet.

To switch between single and double slit mode, press the '1' and '2' keys. This will reset the simulation and switch to either a single slit or double slit.

The 'p' key can be pressed to pause the simulation as the user wishes.
