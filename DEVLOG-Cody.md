Created the fourth version of our UML diagram according to today's suggestions in class. Added code skeletons according to new methods/plan of attack for the sim.

### 2025-05-28 - Source and Wave Class

After thinking about how we will produce spherical waves, I added a Source class for the source of the wavefronts and reworked the Wave class. These updates were also added to the UML.

Wrote the display methods for Source and Wave whilst also creating two types of waves which will be created in the simulation: spherical and planar waves.
