## Diffraction Simulator
We intend to model the diffraction of light through Processing by creating a simulation that offers the ability to analyze both single and double slit diffraction. The user will be able to control various parameters that affect the diffraction pattern of light, and both the interferences and detector screens will be available in the user interface next to each other.

- [The ability to customize factors and the will be modeled on this simulation](https://www.laboratoriovirtual.fisica.ufc.br/redes-de-difracao?lang=en)


## DC Circuits
The objective of this circuit simulation is to create a more friendly user interface that computationally models RL, RC, RLC, and LC circuits. The user will be able to toggle between the three circuit types as well as place electrical components anywhere along the circuit, adjusting resistance, voltage, etc. There will also be a plot of the current and voltage over time to visualize the time constant and maximum voltage/current when discharging or charging.

## Heat Transfer
This simulation will model the heat transfer involved in boiling a pot of water atop a stove. We will use the heat diffusion equation discretized on a 2D grid in Processing. We aim to provide three different modes through which the user can view the heat transfer in (convection, conduction, and radiation), and demonstrate this change with temperature map color gradient. The user will also be able to customize the temperature with user-input to further understand this concept.

- [The image of the boiling pot of water will look something like this](https://images.prismic.io/nutec-fibras/522f2821-6224-4bb9-8500-0d6344483ad8_Explanatory+graph+of+conduction_+convection+and+radiation.png?auto=compress,format)
